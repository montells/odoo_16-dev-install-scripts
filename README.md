# [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com "Odoo's Homepage") Development Install Scripts

These scripts are based on the install script from Yenthe Van Ginneken ([https://github.com/aschenkels-ictstudio/openerp-install-scripts](https://github.com/Yenthe666/InstallScript)).
The original script is splitted and modified to make room for installing Odoo in virtual environments for development.

The first script is to install machine wide requirements and the others are to install Odoo itself.
